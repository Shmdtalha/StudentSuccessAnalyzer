# Smart Student Access Analyzer

Smart Student Access Analyzer is an intelligent prediction system that utilizes data from Learning Management Systems (LMS) to forecast the academic success of students. By analyzing various attributes including visited resources and parental involvement, the system provides valuable insights into students' performance.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Consistent attribute naming, redundant information removal, null value elimination, and categorical data conversion to numerical representation using libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
  
- **Encoding**: Categorical data is encoded into binary representation and separated into individual columns for enhanced processing speed and memory efficiency.

- **Model Creation**: Utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn to build a classification model categorizing students into high marks, low marks, and medium marks.

- **Accuracy**: Achieves a 70-75% accuracy rate in classifying students based on multiple attributes, providing reliable predictions for academic success.
